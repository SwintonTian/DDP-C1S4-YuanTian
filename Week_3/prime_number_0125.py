Prime Number Checker Function

Objective:
Write a function named 'is_prime' to determine whether a given number is a prime number.

Function Parameter:
number (integer): The number to be checked for primality.

Instructions:
- The function should return 'True' if the 'number' is a prime number and 'False' otherwise.
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Consider edge cases, such as when the input is less than 2, which is not a prime number.

Example Test Cases:
1. is_prime(11) should return 'True', as 11 is a prime number.
2. is_prime(4) should return 'False', as 4 is not a prime number.
3. is_prime(2) should return 'True', as 2 is a prime number.
4. is_prime(1) should return 'False', as 1 is not considered a prime number.

# Test cases
print(is_prime(11))  # Expected output: True
print(is_prime(4))  # Expected output: False
print(is_prime(2))  # Expected output: True
print(is_prime(1))  # Expected output: False
print(is_prime(97))
