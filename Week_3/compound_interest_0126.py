Compound Interest Calculator Function

Objective:
Write a function named 'compound_interest_calculator' to calculate compound interest.

Function Parameters:
1. P (float): Principal amount.
2. r (float): Annual interest rate in decimal.
3. n (integer): Number of times interest is compounded per year.
4. t (integer): Number of years for investment.

Instructions:
- Use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) to calculate compound interest.
- Return the accumulated amount A after t years.
- Handle edge cases for inputs.

Example Test Cases:
1. compound_interest_calculator(1000, 0.05, 12, 5) should calculate the amount.
2. compound_interest_calculator(500, 0.07, 4, 10) should calculate the amount.
3. compound_interest_calculator(1500, 0.03, 6, 7) should calculate the amount.

def compound_interest_calculator(P, r, n, t):
    if P<= 0 or r < 0 or n <= 0 or t < 0:
        return "Error"

    A = P*(1 + r/n) ** (n*t)

    return A

# Test cases
print(compound_interest_calculator(1000, 0.05, 12, 5))  # Expected: Amount after 5 years
print(compound_interest_calculator(500, 0.07, 4, 10))  # Expected: Amount after 10 years
print(compound_interest_calculator(1500, 0.03, 6, 7))  # Expected: Amount after 7 years
print(compound_interest_calculator(-1500, 0.03, 6, 7))
